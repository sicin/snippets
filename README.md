# My programming journey

This repository outlines my IT experience, presenting the progress and projects I made throughout my programming journey. Apart from learning about my background, I will be providing excerpts from code I have written (anonymized where necessary).

# The beginnings

### < 1y Python experience

**Stack: Python (Jupyter Notebook)**

It all started with [Microsoft's Python course on edX](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV236x+1T2017/home). It was my first experience with for loops, while statements, functions, if/else, etc. I found the topic extremely interesting and completed the whole course, learning about the basics of programming in the process. Below is the final assignment diagram:

**Stack: Python, Django, HTML, CSS**

One of my motivations for applying for a Master's Degree in Chinese Studies was that I saw them having a course on "Creating Digital Toolkits for Humanities", which was exactly what I wanted at the time. Combining programming with my major and interests, that sounded great. And it was great!

The course was taught by [Dr. Christopher Handy](https://github.com/handyc), an amazing person to whom I owe a lot, since he enabled me to delve deeper into the world of programming. During this one-semester course we were learning the basics of unix systems and command line, SQL databases, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django.

Fueled by a deep passion for the subject I went far and beyond with my final project. I created a full-fledged, responsive (albeit a bit ugly) website converting Chinese units and measurements into their Western counterparts.

Definitely the biggest achievement at this point was the creation of a pretty complex algorithm converting Chinese numerals into Arabic numbers. Since there were no real examples (and one algorithm written in Perl actually had erroneous output in many cases) I had to create it from ground-up. Here's the code if you're interested (types were added later) and some examples:

一千二百三十四亿五千六百七十八万九千 --> 123456789000

四千万零一十 --> 40000010

二亿五千四百三十一万五千 --> 254315000
