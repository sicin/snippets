# My programming journey

This repository outlines my IT experience, presenting the progress and projects I made throughout my programming journey. Apart from learning about my background, I will be providing excerpts from code I have written (anonymized where necessary).

# The beginnings

### < 1y Python experience

**Stack: Python (Jupyter Notebook)**

It all started with [Microsoft's Python course on edX](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV236x+1T2017/home). I found the topic extremely interesting and completed the whole course, learning about the basics of programming in the process. Below is the final assignment diagram:
